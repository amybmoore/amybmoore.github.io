                <h2 id="about">About me</h2>

                <p>Hello, and welcome to my website. I am a creator and designer with a background in apparel, home interiors and architecture as well as software and web design.</p> 
                
                <p>With an interior design degree from UW-Madison, I interned at the Kohler Company, worked as a kitchen and bath designer, and operated my own home-based custom home furnishings business. In that role, I designed, fabricated, and installed soft furnishings for high-end homeowners and designers across Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida, and Illinois.</p>

                <p>At a turning point in my career, I broadened my professional experience by taking on part-time roles as a visitors' bureau director, substitute teacher, and proofreader and copy editor. These positions strengthened my communication, organization, and adaptability skills and clarified my interest in work that blends creativity, structure, and problem-solving. Motivated to continue growing professionally, I returned to school to earn an associate degree in architectural technology and worked as a commercial interior and architectural designer, focusing on K-12 education, senior living, and religious facilities until a layoff in 2020 during COVID.</p>

                <p>While searching for my next architectural role, I accepted a "temporary" position at a church and quickly discovered that I excelled in an administrative and leadership capacity. When the pastor became ill, I managed the church for two and a half years without a pastor. During this time, I restructured inefficient processes, researched and implemented new church management and accounting software, created a new website and mobile app, and oversaw volunteers, marketing, and communications.</p>

                <p>Building on this experience, I decided to further expand my skills in software and IT and returned to school at Fox Valley Technical College, where I am currently pursuing degrees in software development and web development and design. My goal is to combine my design, communications, and technical skills to pursue a career in web design and marketing.</p>

                <p>When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with my headstrong miniature doxie and planting too many fruit trees in my small backyard. As a child of the '80s (the best decade!), I'm also a fan of '80s music and movies.</p>
